# 🚀 AsteroidShooter2D

A Unity project showcasing **VContainer Dependency Injection** and **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** practices.  
The game demonstrates clean architecture, modular systems, and scalable workflows while delivering a simple yet engaging gameplay loop.

---

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview
- Control a rocket that shoots incoming asteroids.  
- **Scoring System:**
  - The more asteroids you destroy before they disappear, the more points you earn.  
  - Missing asteroids results in a penalty, encouraging precision and quick reactions.  
- Designed with a difficulty level to test both player skill and system scalability.

## 🛠️ Technical Highlights
- **VContainer Dependency Injection**  
  - Used to manage lifetimes, register services, and decouple systems.  
  - Promotes modularity and testability across gameplay and UI components.  

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**  
  - Core mechanics (scoring, penalties, rocket controls) are validated through unit tests.  
  - Ensures reliable, maintainable code and safe refactoring.  

- **Clean Architecture Principles**  
  - Separation of concerns between gameplay logic, UI, and data.  
  - Scalable systems that can be extended for new features.  

---

## 📂 Project Goals
- Showcase professional Unity development practices for recruiters and collaborators.  
- Demonstrate how **DI frameworks** and **TDD** can be applied in real-world Unity projects.  
- Provide a foundation for building more complex arcade-style or simulation games.  

---

## 🚧 Future Improvements
- Add power-ups and varied asteroid types.  
- Implement difficulty scaling and progression systems.  
- Expand test coverage for UI and performance profiling.

## 🤝 Purpose
This repository is intended as a **portfolio project** to highlight my skills in Unity, scalable architecture, and modern development workflows.  
It is not a production-ready release, but a demonstration of technical depth and clean coding practices.
